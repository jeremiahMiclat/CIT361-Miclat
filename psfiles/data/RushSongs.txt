Kid Gloves	Grace Under Pressure	1984	1983 was a tough year for us. The last tour was a grind, and everybody had been going through some changes.

Anagram	Presto	1989	Subtitled For Mongo as a tribute to the Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles which contains a scene when the character Bart calls out Candygram for Mongo.
Available Light	Presto	1989	On a tune like 'Available Light,' where the bass just provides some simple, low-end support, I'd rather play the keyboards and sing. It's just a question of what instrument will be rewarding to play from a player's point of view... ~ Geddy Lee
Chain Lightning	Presto	1989	...the whole idea of the song was response and how people respond to things...a lot of the thrust of that song is how things are transferred, like chain lightning or enthusiasm or energy or love are things that are contagious, and if someone feels them, they are easily transferable to another person,...'Reflected in another pair of eyes' is the idea that it's a wonderful thing already,...but if there's someone else there with you to share it, then it multiplies, you know, it becomes exponentially a bigger experience... ~ Neil Peart

Scars	Presto	1989	I think it's part of everyone's experience that a certain record reflects a certain period of their life, and that's a pleasurable scar, you know, there's a mark left on you, a psychological fingerprint left by a very positive experience. And music is an easy one, but it translates to so many other parts of life where it's a given that, for instance, the sense of smell is one of the strongest forces in your memory, where a given smell will suddenly conjure up a whole time of your life, and again, it triggers another scar, it triggers another psychological imprint that was left by a pleasurable thing... ~ Neil Peart

Heresy	Roll the Bones	1991	Inspired by the falling of the Berlin Wall.
Neurotica	Roll the Bones	1991	Some people can't deal with the world as it is, or themselves as they are, and feel powerless to change things—so they get all crazy. They waste away their lives in delusions, paranoia, aimless rage, and neuroses, and in the process they often make those around them miserable, too. Strained friendships, broken couples, warped children. I think they should all stop it. ~ Neil Peart
Roll the Bones	Roll the Bones	1991	Geddy Lee performs the rap section using a digitally lowered version of his voice.
The Big Wheel	Roll the Bones	1991	...It's where I've looked for a universal of that trade-off between innocence and experience, and (The Big Wheel) certainly addresses that.... ~ Neil Peart
Where's My Thing?	Roll the Bones	1991	Gangster of Boats Trilogy: Part IV
You Bet Your Life	Roll the Bones	1991	I particularly like the lyrics in 'You Bet Your Life.' I wove together all the different religions and musical styles and everything. Those kinds of things are really fun and satisfying.... ~ Neil Peart

Animate	Counterparts	1993	Addresses man's anima as defined by Carl Jung.
Between Sun and Moon	Counterparts	1993	Co-written by Pye Dubois. Pete Townshend can make an acoustic sound so heavy and powerful. I've always admired that. On 'Between Sun and Moon' there's a musical bridge before the solo that's very Who-ish. I even throw Keith Richards in there. The song is really a tribute to the '60s. ~ Alex Lifeson
Cold Fire	Counterparts	1993	I had been inspired, I think, by a Paul Simon song, where I wanted to couch song lyrics in conversation—he said, she said, and all that. Simon has a song, maybe on Rhythm of the Saints, where it's in conversation. ~ Neil Peart
Cut to the Chase	Counterparts	1993	Genius is the fire that lights itself. ~ Neil Peart
Double Agent	Counterparts	1993	...it's one of the goofiest songs I think we've ever written, but I'm quite happy with the result. In its own way, I think it's an interesting little piece of lunacy. ~ Geddy Lee
Everyday Glory	Counterparts	1993	This song ended up being an analog-tape mix. For the last few years I've mixed only to digital, because I figured it was just a better tape recorder. But certain songs have a heavier midrange content, and on playback the analog recorder softens the midrange a bit, giving it a more likable sound. ~ Geddy Lee
Leave That Thing Alone	Counterparts	1993	I think this is the best instrumental we've ever written. ~ Geddy Lee
Nobody's Hero	Counterparts	1993	Orchestration: Michael Kamen; Inspired in part by the death of a friend of Neil Peart, named Ellis.
Stick It Out	Counterparts	1993	I love the riff. It's a great riff song. I love playing it, and it's a very bass-heavy song, which always makes me happy. ~ Geddy Lee

Dog Years	Test for Echo	1996	Inspired by the aging profile of dogs.
Driven	Test for Echo	1996	...is just from a bass player's point of view. I wrote that song with three tracks of bass. I brought it to Alex and said, 'Here's the song; I did three tracks of bass, but I just did that to fill in for the guitar,' and he said, 'Let's keep it with the three basses.' So, I said, 'I love you.' ~ Geddy Lee
Half the World	Test for Echo	1996	...is one of our finest moments as songwriters as far as writing a concise song without being wimpy or syrupy. It's got a little bit of everything: nice melody, and yet it's still aggressive. It's hard for us to write that kind of song, really. You'd have to go back to 'Closer to the Heart' to find an example of that.
Limbo	Test for Echo	1996	Instrumental with the inclusion of the line Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist? from the song Monster Mash by Bobby Boris Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers.
Resist	Test for Echo	1996	The instrument played at the beginning of the song is a hammer dulcimer.
Test for Echo	Test for Echo	1996	Co-written by Pye Dubois. The lyrics give a video-view of this wacky world of ours and offers this tacit response: 'Excuse me, does anybody else think this is weird? Am I weird?' While the answer to those questions might be 'Yes!' it's good to know that you're not the only one, that you're not alone. ~ Neil Peart
The Color of Right	Test for Echo	1996	Inspired by the legal term: colour of right.
Time and Motion	Test for Echo	1996	Inspire by music artists Soundgarden and Smashing Pumpkins.
Totem	Test for Echo	1996	The choruses in 'Totem' are really interesting. I created a soundscape by using harmonics with a kind of Celtic melody over it that's quite distant. In the song, in terms of dynamics, it's a really beautiful shift. ~ Alex Lifeson
Virtuality	Test for Echo	1996	Inspired by the concept of virtual reality.

Out of the Cradle	Vapor Trails	2002	Inspired by Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking by Walt Whitman.
Peaceable Kingdom	Vapor Trails	2002	Inspired by the Peaceable Kingdom series of paintings by Edward Hicks. Inspired by the 9/11 tragedy.[citation needed]

Far Cry	Snakes & Arrows	2007	It was almost like we already knew the song when we wrote it. We just played it. And that was really cool. That doesn't happen very often. We were high-fiving and the whole thing, because it's a relief when something like that happens, for sure. ~ Alex Lifeson
Good News First	Snakes & Arrows	2007	I kind of couch the lyrics in the traditional relationship song of a quarrel between two people, but, again, it's in fact me arguing with these whole masses of people who just happen to disagree with me. ~ Neil Peart

Workin' Them Angels	Snakes & Arrows	2007	I didn't think I was foolhardy or irresponsible, but a certain level of risk in life seemed worthwhile for the promised return—excitement and treasured experiences—and though I didn't really believe in 'them angels,' if I had them, I guessed I kept them pretty busy. ~ Neil Peart
